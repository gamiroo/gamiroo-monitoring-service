## Overview

The Gamiroo Monitoring Service is a core microservice within the Gamiroo platform that provides real-time and historical system performance data. This service is responsible for:

- **Metrics Collection:** Gathering performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory, response times) from various backend services.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Retrieving and analyzing historical metric records to identify trends and anomalies.
- **System Health Insights:** Enabling proactive monitoring by providing detailed metrics that support operational decision-making.
- **Integration with External Tools:** Facilitating integration with external monitoring and visualization platforms.

The service exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints designed for administrative dashboards, internal analytics tools, and integration with third-party monitoring systems.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd gamiroo-monitoring-service
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
# On Unix or MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root with the following (adjust values as needed):

ini
Copy
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://youruser:yourpassword@localhost:5432/gamiroo_db
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
Initialize the Database:

Run your migration or initialization script to create the necessary tables. For example, if using an initialization script:

bash
Copy
python init_db.py
Run the Service:

bash
Copy
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The service should now be running on http://localhost:8001.

API Endpoints
Below is a summary of the key endpoint provided by the Monitoring Service. Each endpoint includes a description, sample request parameters, and expected responses.

1. Metrics Retrieval
Endpoint: GET /api/v1/monitoring/metrics

Description: Retrieves system performance metrics, optionally filtered by service name, metric name, or a specific time range.

Request Parameters:

service_name (optional): Filter metrics by the name of the service.
metric_name (optional): Filter metrics by the specific metric (e.g., "CPU_usage", "memory_usage").
start_date and end_date (optional): Define a time range for the records (ISO 8601 format).
Response Example:

json
Copy
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "service_name": "User Service",
    "metric_name": "CPU_usage",
    "value": 72.5,
    "recorded_at": "2025-02-20T12:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "service_name": "Competition Service",
    "metric_name": "response_time",
    "value": 150.0,
    "recorded_at": "2025-02-20T12:01:00Z"
  }
]
Usage Notes:
This endpoint provides detailed metric records and supports filtering to help identify trends, performance bottlenecks, and system anomalies. Use this data to feed dashboards or trigger alerts in external monitoring tools.

Authentication
While the Monitoring Service endpoints are designed for internal consumption, they may be secured in a production environment. If authentication is required, include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

http
Copy
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Tokens are typically issued via an internal authentication mechanism and have a default expiration period as configured.

Error Handling
Database Connection Issues:
If the service cannot connect to the database, a 500 Internal Server Error is returned.
Validation Errors:
Invalid or improperly formatted query parameters will result in a 422 Unprocessable Entity error.
Not Found:
If no metrics match the specified filters, an empty array is returned with a 200 OK status.
Usage Example with cURL
Retrieve Metrics
bash
Copy
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/monitoring/metrics?service_name=User%20Service&metric_name=CPU_usage&start_date=2025-02-20T00:00:00Z&end_date=2025-02-20T23:59:59Z" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Retrieve All Metrics
bash
Copy
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/monitoring/metrics" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
If authentication is enabled, include the Authorization header:

bash
Copy
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/monitoring/metrics" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
Conclusion
The Gamiroo Monitoring Service provides essential capabilities for collecting and analyzing system performance metrics. Its RESTful API is designed for scalability and integration with both internal and external monitoring solutions, allowing you to proactively manage and optimize the performance of your Gamiroo platform.
